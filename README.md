# Deno Tutorial

In spite I know enough Javascript I want to see the particularities of [Deno](https://deno.land). I will start with these videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iLeRzHvc10&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gnaJdxuGvEGYQ9iHb8mxsh

And after that move to a sample project. Realtime Chat with Deno and websockets before starting my own project with Deno and Typescript.
