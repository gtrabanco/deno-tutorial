# Deno Tutorial

In spite I know enough Javascript I want to see the particularities of [Deno](https://deno.land). I will start with the videos of [The Net Ninja Deno Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iLeRzHvc10&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gnaJdxuGvEGYQ9iHb8mxsh)

And after that move to a sample project. Realtime Chat with Deno and websockets before starting my own project with Deno and Typescript.

# Install deno

Using [dotly](https://github.com/codelytv/dotly) dotfiles is as simple as:

```bash
$ dot package install deno
```

If you are not using these dotfiles just fo to official [documentation to install](https://deno.land/#installation).
